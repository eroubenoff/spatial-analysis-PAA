This document provides an overview of the Bayesian method adapated from Alexander
et. al. for small area estimation.

Data: 
- LT quantities: nqx, lx, ndx, nLx, tx, ex, se(nqx), se(ex), mx. Radix: 10,000
- tracts (t; hundreds per county) 
- counties (c; dozens per state)
- states (s; 50)
- ages (a; 0, 1, 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 75, 85+)

Note: only one time period t and as such is eliminated from the model 

PC's: two options.  Either determined empirically from the CDC data or from USAMD. 
Will need to evaluate. 

# Level 1: 
Number of deaths between ages x and x+n for tract t in county c in state s at age x:
$$
d(x, n)_{t, c, s} \sim Poi(m(x)_{t, c, s} * L(x))
$$

$mx$ is a linear combination of the prinicipal components plus an error term 
$$
log(m(x)_{t, c, s}) = \sum_{i \in [1, 3]} \beta_{i, t, c, s} \cdot Y_{i, x} + u_{x, t, c, s}
$$


# Level 2:
Coefficients $\beta$ are normally distributed
$$
\beta_{i, t, c, s} \sim N(\mu_{\beta_i}, \sigma^2_{\beta_i})
$$
Error terms are normally distributed
$$
u_{x, t, c, s} \sim N(0, \sigma^2_x)
$$
